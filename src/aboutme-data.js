    'Ever since I learned Basic on my childhood Commodore 64, I have been fascinated by computers and programming.  I was lucky enough to have a series of computers in my household growing up.  Starting with the Commodore,  through a 286,  486, and finally a Pentium II, I learned not only to use these computers, but also how to program them.  I was always interested in how the software worked.  I spent countless hours playing, from modding video games to building academic software.   In college I studied Computer Science, learning HTML and C++.   Back in the days before CSS.',

    'At 21, I decided to leave school and Computer Science, to pursue my other great passion, cooking.  I spent the next 18 years following that dream, working as a chef, then restaurant owner.  I loved my time in the service industry, but I always wondered about the Computer Science path I left.',

    'As the pandemic entered its first summer, and the fate of the service industry got darker by the day, I was forced to reevaluate my career.  I realized that the skills that I had spent the last twenty years developing: work ethic, leadership, problem solving, and business acumen, would be useful in other industries.  It was time to make a change, and explore a new direction.  If I was going to change careers, there was only one choice: Tech.',

    'I spent the summer of 2020 teaching myself Java and Python. I loved spending the days working out problems, and learning new frameworks.  I spent days working through a Hash Map app that stored all of the words in the Scrabble Dictionary.  I built a 2D side-scrolling game using PyGame.  I made an API server that webscrapped from a local paper’s website.  I loved building these apps, and I loved learning these new skills.',

    'In September I enrolled at Alchemy Code Labs to bring my coding skills to a professional level.  In a short few months I’ve gone from never writing a word of JavaScript to learning React, Node.js, & PostgreSQL.   I spend my days in labs, and my evenings working on coding side projects.   I have also begun volunteering at Code For PDX, building a React app for case workers and property managers assisting people transitioning out of homelessness.',

    'As I enter the next step of my journey I am excited to get out into the industry and help build some stuff!',
