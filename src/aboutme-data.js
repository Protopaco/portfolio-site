    'Over a career that spans decades, industries, and coasts, one thing has remained consistent, my desire to rise to new challenges, and learn from those experiences.',

    'After studying English Lit and Computer Science in college, I followed my dream to become a Chef.  I was running my first kitchen by age twenty six, and started a Farmer’s Market stand two years later.  Before my thirtieth birthday I had grown that humble stand into a brick and mortar restaurant where I was sole Chef and Owner.',

    'I quickly learned that while my skills as Chef were essential in the kitchen, I needed a whole new set of skills to run the business.  Over the proceeding five years I became versed in bookkeeping, management, and all the soft skills involved with running a small business.  The restaurant grew, and soon included a successful retail salsa line. When challenges presented themselves, I was eager to take them on to help our team thrive.  As our lease came to an end, I decided that it was time to move to a larger market, and pursue new challenges.  I sold the salsa business, which can still be found across Northwest Washington.',

    'I moved to Portland, OR and took on the position of Director of Operations at The Original Taco House.  I supervised three restaurant locations, and their 90+ employees.  Running a business on that scale was a new adventure, but I was excited for the opportunity.  As a team we created new systems for communication, goals setting and tracking, and revising menus and pricing, I was able to provide a new level of professionalism and efficiency to this family-owned business.',

    'After leaving The Original Taco House, I took over ownership of the Night Light Lounge, a Southeast Portland institution.  Over the proceeding three years sales grew by 10% year on year, and we rebuilt an amazing team of service professionals.  I also had the pleasure of creating, and growing Portland Drag Queen Brunch.  The largest show of its kind in the Northwest. At the beginning of 2020 we were hosting two hundred attendees each weekend, and began touring to neighboring cities. We were also regularly booked by companies such as Portland Trailblazers, OMSI, and Wieden + Kennedy.',

    '2020, and its effects on the service industry has set my life on a new trajectory.  I’m returning to the Computer Science that I studied in college.  I am excited to bring my experience working on amazing teams, developing high quality products, and working with limited resources to the software world.  I know there are many challenges and adventures in my future, but I know that I will with confidence.',
